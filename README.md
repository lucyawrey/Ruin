# Ruin

An experimental block game set in a ruined world. The purpose of this project is to attempt to build a very efficient minecraft style game using Unity DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack). Ruin is currently abandoned and non functional but I may eventually work on it again when DOTS is more mature and I have more free time.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository locally then open and run the project in a recent version of the Unity Editor that supports DOTS.
